          <h1>Our Services</h1>
          <p>Beauty Way Farms is a full-service facility. We feed twice a day, including any supplements or medications the owners provide. We put on blankets, fly masks, and fly spray when required in addition to tending to any first-aid needs. We will also take care of horses during farrier and vet appointments if needed.</p>
          <p>Each horse is assigned his/her own stall that is cleaned both morning and evening with shavings added as needed. Water buckets are also kept full and checked regularly. The horses live as one large herd in our 15-acre pasture, so all new horses must be a good fit with our current equine residents. As a rule, our horses remain outdoors 24/7, however at the request of the owner—and for a small increase in board—horses will be kept in at night and/or during the day as needed. Unless the owner requests otherwise, all horses are kept in their stalls during inclement weather.</p>

            <h2>Riding Lessons</h2>
            <p>At Beauty Way Farms, we teach from the ground up. We do not only teach students how to ride, but also consider it important for students to learn and understand all other aspects of horsemanship.  We specialize in hunter/jumpers and believe that both the best riders and the happiest horses should learn to work as one.  For this reason, we like to carefully match horses with their riders.  Patience, softness, and physical strength/suppleness are our key values.</p>
            <p>It is of utmost importance to us that both rider and horse are healthy, safe, and treated with dignity. Our lessons require hard work, but we strive to make them fun and interesting for both horse and rider at their particular level of experience.</p>
